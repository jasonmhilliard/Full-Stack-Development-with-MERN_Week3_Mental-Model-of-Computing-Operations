Week3: Mental Model of Computing Operations

I. File list
------------
Three Types of Variable Scopes in JavaScript- Global, Function and Block - Microsoft Word Document
basicTypesOperators - JavaScript File

II. Concept
----------
The word document explains the three types of scopes when dealing with variables in JavaScrip- Global, Function and Block along with some small code examples for each that you can run in the developer tools in the browser console.

The basiTypesOperators JavaScript File allows you to console.log items using the developer tools in the browser. You can copy and paste this JS into the console and it will print out the results. creates an object (in this case a square) and uses Javascript code in order to define an area and move the object around in that specified area within the browser window.  I have defined a variable in JavaScript (var randomColors = [ ];) and assigned a random array of colors to this variable so that the color of the object will constantly change.  To execute the code, all you have to do is drag and drop the HTML file into an empty browser window.


III. Future Improvements
----------
Expansion of the HTML and JavaScript code to produce multiple objects all moving around at the same time within the browser.

IV.  License
----------
The source material for this repository contains information and code from the MITxPRO Full Stack Development with MERN 32 week bootcamp course.
As a student in the course, I have participated in reading the course materials and created my own code throughout all of the course projects. As a result I have provided my own additions, comments, material and code to the repositories along the way.

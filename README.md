# Mental-Model-of-Computing-Operations
Week3: Mental Model of Computing Operations

I. File list
------------
Three Types of Variable Scopes in JavaScript- Global, Function and Block - Microsoft Word Document
basicTypesOperators - JavaScript File
animalsUsingScope - JavaScript File

II. Concept
----------
The word document explains the three types of scopes when dealing with variables in JavaScrip- Global, Function and Block along with some small code examples for each that you can run in the developer tools in the browser console.

The basicTypesOperators JavaScript File allows you to console.log (print out) items using the developer tools in the browser. You can copy and paste this JS code into the console and it will print out the results of the defined variables.

In the animalsUsingScope JavaScript file, you can use this JS code in the developer tools in the browser to practice manipulating variables and try to return the correct animal or pet.


III. Future Improvements
----------
Expansion of the JavaScript code to includ more examples of JS variable scopes.

The source material for this repository contains information and code from the MITxPRO Full Stack Development with MERN 32 week bootcamp course.
As a student in the course, I have participated in reading the course materials and created my own code throughout all of the course projects. As a result I have provided my own additions, comments, material and code to the repositories along the way.
